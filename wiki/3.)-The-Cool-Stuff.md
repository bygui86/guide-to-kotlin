### lambda types, trailing lambdas

In Kotlin, you have a first-party support for "lambda types", which represent a method with a given set of arguments, and a given return type.

Of course, in Java, you could also attempt to mimic it with `java.util.function.*`, but Kotlin's syntax is much more straightforward and easy to use. This might sound like a pitch, but just look at it:

``` kotlin
class MyAdapter(
    private var items: List<Item>,
    private val clickListener: (Item) -> Unit
): RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>() {
    ....
}
```

Where this is created as:

``` kotlin
val adapter = MyAdapter(items) { item ->
    doSomethingWith(item)
}
```

As the last "lambda" argument is passed "outside" the parentheses.

If we are passing multiple lambdas, it is preferred to use named arguments for both.

``` kotlin
createDialog(title, description,
    onPositiveClick = { yay() },
    onNegativeClick = { nay() }
)
```

What is important to note is that interfaces defined in Java can be used with lambda types of Kotlin thanks to SAM conversion.

Another thing to know is that a single-argument lambda implicitly names its argument `it`, but any name can be given to that variable.

If we have multiple variables but there are unused ones, we can use `_` as a name for them.

``` kotlin
someView.setOnClickListener { view -> // if unnamed, it is called `it`
    // ...
}

someView.waitForMeasure { _, _, _ -> 
    // unused parameters can be named as `_`
}
```

***Beware:*** Kotlin code can become *very* messy if `it` is over-used. Pretend it is called `x`. If it is hard to read without IDE support, don't use `it`.

***Also important:*** One more thing to note is that in a lambda expression in Kotlin, the last line's return value is returned as the return value, and `return` is explicitly not required.

However if we still want to add a return (or we need to `return` from a lambda above the last line), then we can use `return@[caller]`, for example `return@onClick`.

### method reference

Any function of any class can be passed as a lambda using the `function reference` operator.

``` kotlin
fun acceptsLambda(lambda: () -> Unit) {
    if(...) {
        lambda() // same as `lambda.invoke()`
    }
}

fun doSomething() {
}

fun execute() {
    acceptsLambda(::doSomething)
}
```

### `typealias`

One can use a `typealias` to give a name to a given type.

What's nice is that one can also provide template parameters for typealiases.

For example, it can be used to name lambda parameters in case they are unclear.

``` kotlin
typealias ItemClickListener = (Item) -> Unit

class MyAdapter(
    private var items: List<Item>,
    private val clickListener: ItemClickListener
): RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>() {
    ....
}
```

### lambdas with receivers

Kotlin has a very powerful construct called a "lambda with receiver". This means that inside a given lambda, the parameter it's invoked on is seen as `this`.

For example:

``` kotlin
fun runTransaction(realm: Realm, transaction: Realm.() -> Unit) { // should be ext. fun
    realm.executeTransaction {
        transaction(realm)
    }
}

runTransaction {
    insertOrUpdate(Dog("Hello"))
    insertOrUpdate(Cat("World"))
}
```

### extension functions, extension properties

Extension functions are functions you define that lets you invoke functions on given classes as if they were functions of that given class.

This enables you with the ability to enhance classes without having to extend them or wrap them with custom classes - instead, define a function somewhere as a top-level extension function, and you can "magically" use this function anywhere (as long as you import it).

``` kotlin
fun View.show() {
    this.visibility = View.VISIBLE
}

fun View.hide() {
    this.visibility = View.GONE
}

// myView.visibility = View.VISIBLE
myView.show()
```

You can also specify extension properties.

``` kotlin
var View.isVisible: Boolean
    get() = this.visibility == View.VISIBLE
    set(value) {
        if (value) {
            show()
        } else {
            hide()
        }
    }
```

In Kotlin, this feature might be *the most powerful* feature, especially considering it respects generic bounds, too.

``` kotlin
inline fun Array<Account>.forEachNonDemo(action: (Account) -> Unit) {
    this.filter { !it.isDemo() }.forEach(action)
}
```

And it allows you to add numerous "utils" or "helper" functions to your class as if it was already part of it, without using inheritance to add new behavior.

``` kotlin
fun View.objectAnimate() = ViewPropertyObjectAnimator.animate(this)
```

And just to show you a real example for what this looks like, this is what I use for the fade animation of views (this is actually what I was showing off as an example [**in this thread on Reddit** about benefits of using Kotlin](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/9l2xv9/what_are_the_advantages_to_switching_existing/e75giod/).)

``` kotlin
fun View.animateFadeOut(duration: Long = 325, hideOnFinish: Boolean = true): Animator = run {
    alpha = 1f
    objectAnimate()
        .alpha(0f)
        .setDuration(duration)
        .get()
        .apply {
            if (hideOnFinish) {
                onFinish {
                    hide()
                }
            }
        }
}

fun View.animateFadeIn(duration: Long = 325, showOnStart: Boolean = true): Animator = run {
    alpha = 0f
    objectAnimate()
        .alpha(1f)
        .setDuration(duration)
        .get()
        .apply {
            if (showOnStart) {
                onStart {
                    show()
                }
            }
        }
}
```

So if you have any `DateUtils` or `StringUtils` or `ContextUtils` class, it should probably be top-level extension functions.

### standard library functions - scoping functions: `apply`, `let`, `also`, `run`, `with`

Now that we know we can create extension functions and we can also apply generic bounds to them, and we also know about lambdas-with-receivers, now we can understand the standard library scoping functions and how they work.

First we have `let` and `run`, which can return a new type after performing the lambda:

``` kotlin
inline fun <R, T> T.let(transform: (T) -> R): R = transform(this) 
```

``` kotlin
inline fun <R, T> T.run(transform: T.() -> R): R = transform(this)
```

Then we have `also` and `apply`, which return the current object once the lambda is executed:

``` kotlin
inline fun <T> T.also(action: (T) -> Unit): T {
    action(this)
    return this
}
```

``` kotlin
inline fun <T> T.apply(action: T.() -> Unit): T {
    action(this)
    return this
}
```

And we have one last odd-one-out called `with`, which works like `apply` except it is a top-level function instead of an extension function.

``` kotlin
inline fun <T> with(t: T, action: T.() -> Unit) {
    action(t)
}
```

If you've not really seen Kotlin before, then you might be thinking "wait WTF how are these useful", but trust me they make code much simpler once you know how to use them.

Here are a few noteworthy examples.

- `apply/also`

`apply` is often used when an object is being configured before it is assigned to a value (or returned from a function).

`also` is used for the same thing, except it allows you to rename the variable you are operating on, instead of seeing it as `this`. 

For example,

``` kotlin
fun okHttpClient() = OkHttpClient.Builder().apply {
    setInterceptor(NetworkInterceptor())
    baseUrl(BuildConfig.BASE_URL)
}.build()
```

Or

``` kotlin
fragment.arguments = Bundle().also { bundle -> 
    bundle.putString("hello", "hello")
}
```

Imagine that you are writing Java. You need to create a local variable instead of writing the assignment directly.

``` java
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putString("hello", "hello");
fragment.setArguments(bundle);
```

With scoping functions, we can merge these operations together. This is especially nice if you're working with mutable lists that you are adding items into.

- `let`/`run`

`let` lets you execute a block which can return a new type after its execution. `run` lets you do the same thing, except you see the current object as `this`.

This can be useful if you don't want to create a local variable but you're "mapping" your object into something else.

``` kotlin
val domainObject = dao.findFirst<MyClass>().let { DomainObject(it) }
```

It is also fairly common to combine `let` with the `?.` and `?:` safe-call / elvis operators.

`run` is similar but when you want to use the current object as `this`. Another nice trick with `run` is that you can turn a multi-line function into a single-line one, here is an example.

``` kotlin
fun someFunction() {
    val someValue = "beep" // some local variable you cannot avoid, or scoping functions would make hard to read
    return result
}
```

We can turn this into:

``` kotlin
fun someFunction() = run {
    val someValue = "beep"
    result
}
```

- `with`

`with` can be used for reducing the number of times we refer to the same variable over and over again. 

For example,

``` kotlin
with(recyclerView) {
    adapter = MyAdapter()
    layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this@MyActivity) 
}
```

### standard library functions - more utility functions: `takeIf`, `takeUnless`

There are two more standard library functions that people actually often forget to mention, `takeIf` and `takeUnless` (in which case `takeUnless` is actually just `!=` for `takeIf`).

``` kotlin
inline fun <T> T.takeIf(predicate: (T) -> Boolean): T? {
    if(predicate(this)) { 
        return this 
    }
    return null
}
```

Or with a `when` statement (just to get used to using it):

``` kotlin
inline fun <T> T.takeIf(predicate: (T) -> Boolean): T? = when {
    predicate(this) -> this
    else -> null
}
```

It might seem like an odd function, but it's actually very powerful in certain assignments, especially if you need to define a non-null default value that you'd prefer to ignore.

``` java
int someNumber = bundle.getInt("someNumber", -1);
if(someNumber == -1) {
   // uninitialized!
}
```

As it is uninitialized, we might want to model it with `null` instead.

``` java
Integer someNumber = bundle.getInt("someNumber", -1);
if(someNumber == -1) {
   someNumber = null;
}
```

And we can turn this into a single-liner with Kotlin.

``` kotlin
val someNumber = bundle.getInt("someNumber", -1).takeIf { it >= 0 }
```

And it gets better when we combine this with `?.let`.

``` kotlin
val someText = bundle.getInt("someNumber", -1).takeIf { it >= 0 }?.let { "$it" }
```

And maybe even give it a default non-null value.

``` kotlin
val someText = bundle.getInt("someNumber", -1).takeIf { it >= 0 }?.let { "$it" } ?: ""
```

Or throw an exception.

``` kotlin
val someText = something.takeIf { condition } ?: throw IllegalArgumentException("$something is invalid")
```

### `tailrec` keyword

In Kotlin, a recursive function that is "tail-recursive" can be forced to be optimized, in the sense that its real implementation will use a for-loop (iterative solution) instead of a recursive one. This means the function does not need to use the stack to store previous results and is therefore safe to use even for larger numbers.

When you write a recursive function, it's best to check if you can use `tailrec`. If you can, then the compiler won't nag you about it.

``` kotlin
tailrec fun <T: Activity> findActivity(context: Context): T {
    if(context is Activity) {
        return context as T
    }
    if(context is ContextWrapper) {
        val baseContext = context.baseContext
        return findActivity(baseContext)
    }
    throw IllegalArgumentException("The context does not contain an Activity reference!")
}
```

### `inline` functions (`crossinline`, `noinline`)

I've previously used `inline` functions without explaining them; it means that the lambda we pass in will be *inlined* instead of creating an anonymous implementation for the given lambda type.

This pretty much means that inline lambdas don't have the cost of creating an anonymous instance for the interface, and that means it's *cheaper* as there is no actual object instance instantiation by calling a function with a lambda argument!

``` kotlin
inline fun <T> doSomething(action: (T) -> Unit) {
    // action is inlined instead of creating a new 
    // anonymous implementation / instance of the lambda interface
}
```

However, due to some trickery in how inline returns work, there are restrictions sometimes, which once we understand can actually still be quite handy.

1.) `noinline` means that the argument won't be inlined even if it's an `inline` function

2.) `crossinline` means that the argument will be invoked inside another lambda that is not inlined.

Okay, you may ask "when are these useful?"

`noinline` is useful if you need the lambda to be an instance, for example if it is actually being passed to a SAM-converted method.

`crossinline` is typically useful if you're passing the lambdas as implementations to an object with multiple implementation. I'll show you my favorite example of this.

``` kotlin
myEditText.addTextChangedListener(object: TextWatcher {
    override fun afterTextChanged(s: Editable) {
         newValue = s.toString()
    }

    override fun beforeTextChanged(s: CharSequence?, start: Int, count: Int, after: Int) {                
    }

    override fun onTextChanged(s: CharSequence?, start: Int, before: Int, count: Int) {
    }
})
```

can be converted into

``` kotlin
inline fun EditText.onTextChanged(crossinline eventHandler: (String) -> Unit) {
    this.addTextChangedListener(object: TextWatcher {
        override fun afterTextChanged(s: Editable) {
             eventHandler(s.toString())
        }

        override fun beforeTextChanged(s: CharSequence?, start: Int, count: Int, after: Int) {                
        }

        override fun onTextChanged(s: CharSequence?, start: Int, before: Int, count: Int) {
        }
    })
}
```

And now you can use it:

``` kotlin
myEditText.onTextChanged {
    newValue = it
}
```

So we had to add `crossinline` to be able to call our lambda inside the `object: TextWatcher`'s functions. This actually happens quite often, as we can see in another example:

``` kotlin
inline fun <reified T: ViewModel> AppCompatActivity.createViewModel(
    crossinline factory: () -> T
): T = T::class.java.let { clazz ->
    ViewModelProviders.of(this, object: ViewModelProvider.Factory {
        override fun <T : ViewModel?> create(modelClass: Class<T>): T {
            if(modelClass == clazz) {
                @Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
                return factory() as T
            }
            throw IllegalArgumentException("Unexpected argument: $modelClass")
        }
    }).get(clazz)
}
```

In which case we invoke the lambda inside the function of `ViewModelProvider.Factory`.

### a glance at [the Collections API](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/index.html#functions) 

We can use methods such as `map`, `filter`, `groupBy` and so on.

Let me show you an actual use-case where I had a `List<Event>` that needed to be converted to `Map<Long, List<Event>>` where each event was separated into a separate list and grouped by their start date.

``` kotlin
val calendar = Calendar.getInstance()
val dateEventMap = eventList.groupBy { event ->
    calendar.timeInMillis = event.startTimeMillis
    calendar.resetHoursMinutesSecondsMillis()
    calendar.timeInMillis
}
```

It's worth knowing that if you catch yourself iterating a list, collecting items by key into a map; then you should be using `groupBy` which does this for you in a single method call.

There are many such similar functions in the Collections API and I urge you to check them out.

### `inline fun <reified T>`

In Java, there are times when you must pass a `Class<T>` to a given method. 

``` java
RealmQuery<MyObject> query = realm.where(MyObject.class);
```

In Kotlin though, this typically looks like 

``` kotlin
val query = realm.where(MyObject::class.java)
```

Which looks very tacky!

The good news is that we can define an `inline fun <reified T>` method which behind the scenes passes the Class object for us, while we can invoke it as a regular extension function. This means that we can access `T::class.java` if the template variable is `reified`. I'll show you what I mean.

``` kotlin
inline fun <reified T: RealmModel> Realm.where(): RealmQuery<T> = this.where(T::class.java)
```

And now you can use it like this:

``` kotlin
val query = realm.where<MyObject>()
```

Or like this

``` kotlin
val query: RealmQuery<MyObject> = realm.where()
```

Personally, whenever I see a `::class.java`, I wonder "can I make an `inline fun <reified T>` for this?" and if I can, I make an extension function for it. In some cases you can't (typically if you need to pass the class to a constructor), but you should where you can.
  
### `sealed` classes

I've been waiting for this, `sealed class` in Kotlin is a very powerful construct. Although you could just say "enums on steroids".

This means that you can create regular classes (data class, object) that extend from a given base-class, and it is enforced that *these are the only possible implementations of this base-class*.

This is important because it means you can use exhaustive `when` statements over them.

``` kotlin
sealed class Message {
    data class TextMessage(val text: String): Message()
    data class PictureMessage(val image: ByteArray): Message()
}
```

and now we can actually use `when` for a `message` instance, and check its type. No more ugly `instanceof`s, and no need for adding a `Visitor` just to avoid `instanceof`s; and no need to add an `abstract fun` where you don't really need it.

``` kotlin
val message = ...
when(message) {
   is TextMessage -> println("${message.text}")
   is PictureMessage -> sendToFriends(message.image)
}.safe()
```

### `infix` keyword

Another interesting tidbit (although in my opinion, one of the most over-abused ones) is the ability to define `infix` functions.

Infix means that if you have a function that takes only 1 argument, then you can replace the function with a different syntax. Check the example below.

``` kotlin
val pair: Pair<String, Int> = name.to(age) // not infix

val pair: Pair<String, Int> = name to age // infix
```

Basically it lets you throw out the `.__(__)` and call the function as "if it was a language construct / keyword". This is also how `until` is implemented.

### tuples (`to`) and destructuring

In the above example, I showed that `to` exists to create `Pair<S, T>`, and there's actually also a `Triple<S, T, U>`.

What's really nice is that tuples such as `Pair` or `Triple` can be "destructured" by **index**.

You can actually destructure *any* data classes, because they all get `component1`...`componentN` methods, although that is generally not recommended. Primarily prefer destructuring only for classes meant to be used as tuples.

Here is how it looks.

``` kotlin
val triple = Triple(name, age, birthdate)

val (name, age, birthdate) = triple
```

You may ask "hold on how is this useful?" but there are actual use-cases where creating a class with named arguments is excessive, and we could just use a tuple instead.

``` kotlin
fun <T1, T2> Observable<T1>.combineWith(other: Observable<T2>): Observable<Pair<T1, T2>> =
    Observable.combineLatest(this, other, BiFunction<T1, T2, Pair<T1, T2>> { t1, t2 -> t1 to t2 })
```

which now I can use as

``` kotlin
firstObservable.combineWith(secondObservable)
               .subscribeBy(onNext = { (firstValue, secondValue) ->
                   ...
               })
```
